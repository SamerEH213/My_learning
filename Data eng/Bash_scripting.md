# Basics..
- consol vs shell vs terminal:
    - terminal--> A program that provides a user interface to interact with a computer system through text-based input and output.
    - shell --> A command interpreter program that enables users to interact with an operating system, executing commands and scripts, example: zsh.
          - You can know your default shell:
                      - echo $SHELL .
          - You can know all shell types :
                      - ls /bin/*sh .
    - consol --> The interface where users can input commands and execute them to perform specific tasks or operations, python interpreter .
 
- Usefull commands :
  - source --> command is used to execute the content of a script within the current shell environment, ex:source /path/to/myscript.sh  .
  - whoami -->  is used to print the username of the current user .
  - ifconfig (linux)--> print public ip address .
  - ipconfig getifaddr en0 (mac) --> print public ip address .

       2)Second --> Copying the public key into your server using .ssh/authorized_keys .
       3)Third -->  connect with your server using ssh username@remote_host.
                     - username for server ( can find username throgh whoami ).
                     - remote_host --> public IP address for your sever .
                     - ssh -N -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 username@ip  ( if you need connect with specific port in server and local machine ) .
